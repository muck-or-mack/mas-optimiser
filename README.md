# mas-optimiser

Planning-layer evolution for multi-agent systems. An optimiser proposes
changes to how a planner-executor system plans (its planner prompt, plan
constraints and replanning rules) and keeps a change only when a paired test
on tasks it has not seen supports it. The system is evaluated on
[EnterpriseOps-Gym](https://github.com/ServiceNow/EnterpriseOps-Gym), a
benchmark of enterprise IT-operations workflows graded by SQL checks on the
final database state.

Status: early development. Nothing here produces results yet.

## Install

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Python 3.11 or newer (uv
fetches a suitable Python if the system one is older). From the repository
root:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This installs exactly the versions in `uv.lock` and runs the unit tests.
Afterwards, run commands inside the environment with `uv run`, for example
`uv run pytest`.
